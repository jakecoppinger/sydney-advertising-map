Sydney Advertising Map
======================

Live at sydneyadvertisingmap.com! See the announcement blog at https://jakecoppinger.com/2022/10/mapping-sydney-billboards-a-map-of-every-qms-advertising-screen-in-sydney-with-photographs/ for further details.

Through August and October I visited every QMS advertising panel in Sydney. I surveyed their
location and ref code to add to OpenStreetMap, an open geospatial database that powers many maps
worldwide. I uploaded photos of many displays to Mapillary, which you can view by clicking on pins
in the map.

Travelling on foot and by bike I found many examples of this street furniture blocking footpaths
and reducing pedestrian amenity.

I hope this open data, map and photographs encourages and enables further public discussion, such
as where problematic panels are located, and what role large format outdoor advertising has on Sydney’s streets.

As of October 29:

- There are 143 mapped panels QMS panels (excluding bus shelters) in the City of
  Sydney (https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1nbB)
- 30 panels do not have a ref code mounted on them (https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1nbC)

The code quality isn't great - I built this in a weekend. I promise I write better code usually!
